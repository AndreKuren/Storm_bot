## **Submitting patches**

The best way to submit a patch is to issue a pull request on GitHub, optionally creating a new issue first.

Remember to explain the new functionality (what it is, why it’s needed, etc). The more info you include, the easier will be for core developers to understand and accept your patch.

You can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the patch, but it’s always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation in the **[Telegram chanel](https://t.me/Storm_HACK_TON)** to discuss your idea first.

You can pull an existing pull request to a local branch by running git fetch upstream pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:$BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE (replace ‘upstream’ with a remote name for Storm_bot repository, $PR_NUMBER with an ID of the pull request, and $BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE with a name of the branch you want to create locally). See also: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally#modifying-an-inactive-pull-request-locally.

When writing GitHub pull requests, try to keep titles short but descriptive.

### Have a nice day and welcome to [our community](https://t.me/storm_trade_fam)!
